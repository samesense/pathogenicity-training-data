| MPC | pathogenicity of  de novo missense
variants | Pathogenic: ClinVar and ExAC MAF>1%, Benign: | [MPC](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/12/148353.full.pdf) | We selected
missense variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1% in ExAC as our benign set
(n = 82,932 variants after removing those variants missing one of the metrics) and used
the ClinVar missense variants found in haploinsufficient genes that cause severe
disease as our set of pathogenic variants (n = 402 after removing variants missing one
of the metrics). |

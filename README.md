| MPC | pathogenicity of  de novo missense variants | *Pathogenic*: ClinVar; *Benign*: ExAC MAF>1% | 2017 | [MPC](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/06/12/148353.full.pdf) | We selected missense variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) > 1% in ExAC as our benign set (n = 82,932 variants after removing those variants missing one of the metrics) and used the ClinVar missense variants found in haploinsufficient genes that cause severe disease as our set of pathogenic variants (n = 402 after removing variants missing one of the metrics). |
| MTR | gene-customized approach to missense variant interpretation | not trained | 2017 | [MTR](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2017/08/30/gr.226589.117.full.pdf) | NA |
| CCR | find constrained regions | not trained | 2017 | [CCR](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2017/11/22/220814.full.pdf) | NA |
